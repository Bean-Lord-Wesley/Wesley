      <h3>Smart Goal</h3>
      
      <p> My smart goal for the year is to get an A+ on my future essays. I want to get A's because it will teach me how to write a good essay in high school.
    </p>
      
      <h3>Stretch</h3>
      
   <p> My stretch is to work on my outloud reading. This has been my strectch and I have been working on this stretch since the beginning of this school year. I have been trying to enhance my outloud reading by volunteering more to read in class. Doing this has definitly helped and I am noticing a difference in my reading.</p>
      
      <h3>Strength</h3>
      
      <p>My strength is my good teamwork and collaboration. I work well with others and enjoy it more than working alone. an example of my good collaboration was during a spanish presentation, my partner did not memorize their lines and we had until the end of class for him to memorize it. I made sure to help him out and we stayed focused. We completed memorizing it and still managed to get a good grade.</p>
      
      <h3>Social Studies</h3>
      
      <p>In Social Studies I have worked on my stretch by volunteering more to read and reading homework outloud. An example of how reading outloud helps me was when i got an A on a reading comprehension project called The Farewell. </p>

      <h3>Literature</h3>
      
      <p> In Literature I have worked on my stretch by reading the Scarlet Letter outloud, this has helped me to understand what went on in the book. So when I made my poem I understood what I needed to do to get a good grade and I got an A.

      <h3> Spanish </h3>
      
      <p> In spanish I have shown how I work with partners. I had a project my partner and I worked on and he did not memorize his parts. We had time to work on it during class and I focused and assumed a role of leadership. We ended up doing our project at the end of class and we did well and got a good grade.

      <h3> Mathematics </h3>
     <p>In mathematics, my strength and stretch are not represented, but when taking notes in class I have done better on the work our class gets.
