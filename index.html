    <h1> Extra-Curricular Activities</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Arena Soccer</li>
        <li>Friday Night Lights</li>
        <li>Ultimate Frisbee</li>
      </ul>
      
    <p>These extra-curricular activities are what I enjoy most. These sports have made me improve my stamina and athletics. These activities have helped me grow as a person, kind of like a blooming flower. These have taught me to have patience and give everything my best. </p>
      <h3>Social Life at School</h3>
      <p>My social life at school is very good. I have no trouble connecting with others and I have great friends. I would say we do not have friend groups so everyone can fit in and no one is excluded. I assumed a leadership role when I worked on a technology project with my partner. I took the leadership role by making my partner and I focus and was the oversaw what we were doing. I have completed most of my work on time and have not had to turn in any late assignments.<p/>
